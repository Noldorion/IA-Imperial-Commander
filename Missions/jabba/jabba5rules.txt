<b>At the beginning of each round:</b> If there are non-retrieved spice barrels on the map, place 1 Imperial Officer on each non-retrieved spice barrel (maximum 2). If possible, first use figures set aside, then from Manual Deployment. The Imperial Officer immediately retrieves the spice barrel.

When an Imperial Officer carrying a spice barrel moves adjacent to or on the Spicer's stockpile, the Imperial AI claims that barrel. Then, remove that figure from the map and set it aside. (It is not defeated.)

<b>Mission instructions (add to the top of the instruction list):</b>
All Imperial Officers carrying spice barrels gain:
