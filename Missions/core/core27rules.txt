<b>At the beginning of each round after the event <color="red">Find the Droid</color> has been resolved:</b>
If the memory core is not retrieved, place 1 Imperial Officer on the core or adjacent to it. If possible, first use figures set aside, then from Manual Deployment. The Imperial Officer immediately retrieves the memory core.

When the Imperial Officer carrying the memory core moves on the entrance, he escapes with the memory core. If the Imperial Officer is defeated, set its figure aside instead and do not defeat the deployment group. (It still counts as defeated for the purpose of triggering effects.) If the Imperial Officer activates before the figure is placed back on the map again, ignore its activation and trigger the next activation.

<b>Mission instructions (add to the top of the instruction list):</b>
The Imperial Officer carrying the memory core gains:
